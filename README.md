# JReader
Japanese reader that tracks what words you've seen and highlights new words when reading. Deconjugates words so that different forms of the same word will be tracked under the same dictionary entry. Goal is for this to function as a plugin to be used on any japanese webpage. 

# Build
This plugin only supports Firefox so far. To build the plugin a JMdict_e.json file is needed (stored as JMdict_e.json.txt to avoid ![this](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-linter/issues/1700 signing issue)). See https://github.com/tkshnwesper/JMdict-Parser
